Demonstration videos including Gazebo world simulation + real environment tests available :[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DtySa7mKkJHHyVaM0ivvL8W2IMEAQMcw?usp=sharing).

Detailed explanation of project and it's development available :[here](https://github.com/djr111/Robot_Explorer_of_unknown_space_with_LiDAR_ROS_and_TurtleBot3/blob/673d99a25ad32577188e76663ae5330bcb987053/Dissertation.BulsRaimonds1912944.docx).  
  
This reposity contains all the ROS files and packages used for my project, including three SLAM algorithms  
Gmapping, Explore_Lite and RRT_exploration  
  
Project was based on TurtleBot3 model waffle_Pi and only open-source available software
